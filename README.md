## 📌 Problem Statement

In the modern world, energy management is a critical issue for both households and energy providers. Accurate forecasting of energy consumption allows:

- Better planning and optimization of resources
- Cost reduction for consumers
- Efficient energy distribution for providers

**Goal**: Build a machine learning model that predicts household energy consumption using historical data. This model helps:

- Households gain insights into their usage patterns
- Energy providers forecast demand more effectively

By the end of this project, the model should deliver actionable insights and serve as a foundation for smart energy management systems.

## 🧭 Approach

### 1. 🔍 Data Understanding & Exploration
- Load and inspect the dataset
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identify patterns, outliers, and correlations

### 2. 🧹 Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing/inconsistent values
- Parse date & time into useful features
- Engineer new features: daily averages, peak hours, rolling stats
- Normalize/scale data

### 3. 🛠️ Feature Engineering
- Select relevant predictors for power consumption
- Integrate external data (e.g., weather), if available

### 4. 🧪 Model Selection & Training
- Split data into training and test sets
- Train and evaluate models:  
  `Linear Regression`, `Random Forest`, `Gradient Boosting`, `Neural Networks`
- Perform hyperparameter tuning

### 5. 📈 Model Evaluation
- Evaluate using: `RMSE`, `MAE`, `R²`
- Compare and select the best-performing model
